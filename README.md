# Three Point Estimation

Developed By: Prathmesh Pardhiye

About: You’re eager to get ahead at work, so you’ve just volunteered to take on a new task. Your boss says “Great, how long will it take?”
What probably happens: you pause for a moment, think about the task, then guess at a number. “Ten days,” you say. “OK,” says your boss, “ten days it is.” You’re just guessing, but your boss takes it as a firm commitment, and it becomes your new deadline. Ten days later, when you don’t hit the deadline, you’re in trouble.
What might have happened instead: you pause for a moment, think about the task, then choose three numbers: a nominal estimate -- “I think it will take ten days…” an optimistic estimate “but if everything works out, it might take as little as three days...” and a pessimistic estimate: “... worst case, if I can’t get everything I need, it might be as long as two weeks.”  Reaching for your phone, you enter those three numbers in the app you just wrote for CPSC 411, examine the results, and tell your boss “Ten days plus or minus two.” Your boss says “OK, we’ll put it on the calendar for three weeks from today.”  You hit the deadline with plenty of time to spare. Keep it up and you’re sure to get that next promotion!
The technique you just used is called Three-point estimation. There are several different ways to do this, but PERT starts with a nominal (normal or usual) estimate, an optimistic estimate, and a pessimistic estimate and computes a mean estimate and standard deviation.
